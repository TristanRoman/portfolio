                        I work in business management at a Fortune 100 tech company, where 
                        I’ve completed three years of rotations across multiple functions. 
                        That breadth has given me a full-stack view of how product, operations, 
                        and go-to-market fit together—and how to translate between business goals 
                        and technical execution. I’m now leaning into the AI/data-science wave: 
                        sharpening Python/SQL/ML skills and applying them to build analytics and 
                        intelligent tools that create measurable impact. Drawing on a B.S. in Management 
                        Information Systems and an in-progress M.S. in Data Science at UC San Diego, 
                        I bridge business strategy with modern analytics and machine learning to deliver 
                        measurable impact.

                        In an individualized sense, at my core, I am task and goal 
                        oriented. What this results in is me having an inclination
                        to break down a business context into actionable tasks 
                        that can be tracked towards measurable goals. By living 
                        by this orientation, I am able to work with abstract 
                        problems that require unique solutions.

                        Out of all the traits I possess, I am most proud of my 
                        conscientiousness. I find it a valuable trait as a 
                        conscientious individual is one who strives to notice 
                        detail and thoroughly apply themselves. At the end of 
                        the day, I persistently seek to materialize high quality 
                        results.

                        Fowler College of Business has oriented my business 
                        understanding to knowing business processes are cross
